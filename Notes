API:
pepse.util - we will need to add more classes

CLASSES TO ADD:
1. already in the given API:
    Block - every rectangle in the screen (extends GameObject)
    Terrain - create all ground blocks (not GameObject)
            can get the ground height in given coordinate
            create a list of all ground blocks in given x range
    Avatar - create an avatar who moves to the sided and jump. Platformer class is given, we can use for inspiration.
    Flora - create trees

2. not in the API:
    Energy class?
    Related Flora classes:
    - create static trees
    - leaves moving strategy
    - fruits
    Related Clouds classes:
    - moving strategy
    - rain strategy


DESIGN QUESTIONS:
- our layers (background, ground, sun and sunHalo, night, trees trunk, trees leaves, avatar, fruits)
- the advantages of Block class instead of just GameObject
- the "create" methods for Night, Sun, SunHalo (inheritance?)
- how to update the sunHalo location (override update or use addComponent with lambda)?
- showing the energy - how to update it? contain a class or use callback?
- changing in the avatar - how to update other object obout a jump?


TASKS:
1. Sky
    simple object add

2. Ground
    new class - Block (How?)
    new class - Terrain (How?)

3. Light and Darkness
    new class - Night, adding new Block object
    using Transition - changing transparency with Callback (code is given)

4. Sun
    new class - Sun, creating new GameObject
    using Transition

5. Sun Halo
    new class - SunHalo, creating new GameObject
    update location

6. Add character
    new class - Avatar, creating an avatar
    constructor is given
    update - gain and waste energy methods
    addEnergy method
    animate and jumping

7. Flora
    new class - Flora, with a method who create trees
    create static trees
    - leaf moves
        add transitions with delays
    - add fruits
        add fruits on the tree, create collision strategy

8. Cloud
    create new Block for a cloud
    create cloud moves
    create rain

9. Infinity World
    new class Camera?
    create new object while running, using Random seed
